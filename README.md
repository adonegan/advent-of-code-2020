# Advent of Code 2020

My first time solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) puzzles. In the past I've used Python for mini web projects (using frameworks like Flask and Django) but never for puzzle problem-solving. Looking to improve myself in this area. No background in comp sci, so it's a steep learning curve so far! Here to attempt and then codealong where I can.
